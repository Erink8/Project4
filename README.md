# Project4

For this project our team was tasked to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with other technologies that weâ€™ve learned throughout our course while following specific requirements.

# Our Project
## Develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies stroke patients early.

### Exloring Datasets

To begin, we explored healthcare datasets, looking for data that included other health factors in addition to whether a patient had a stroke or not, as this would be key in helping us build a model that could predict with high accuracy. We found a dataset that has been built for stroke prediction online at Kaggle.com that included 11 clinical features for predicting stroke events.

## Analyzing our Data

Using a DataBricks notebook, Python, and Spark SQL we were able to review and analyze the stroke prediction data to learn more about the patients included in the data and how the clinical features may factor into our predictions. Our DataBricks notebook can be found here and will be live for 6 months:

Using a DataBricks notebook, we were able to easily develop visualization from our table and analysis to create dashboard for sharing and updating our findings. The DataBricks Dashboard can be found here and will be live for 6 months:

Using Google Collab, we imported the cleaned csv file and began to train, test, and optimize our model.
